# Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn

Fantastic book on Machine Learning by Aurélien Géron. It's the first volume of a two-part series (the sequel covers Deep Learning)

There exists an [official repo](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml3) as a support, which I'll be using extensively.

### About this repo

I already read the book several times over the years, but never took notes... I figured it would be a nice time to do so.
